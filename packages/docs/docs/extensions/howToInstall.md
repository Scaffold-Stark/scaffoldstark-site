# How to Install Extensions

This guide explains what are extensions and how to use them in your Scaffold-Stark 2 project.

## What are Extensions?

Extensions are modular add-ons for Scaffold-Stark 2 that provide additional functionality or serve as examples for specific features.

:::info Info
Extensions can only be installed during the initial setup of a new Scaffold-Stark 2 project.
:::info Info

They offer several benefits:

- Seamless integration with the base Scaffold-Stark 2 project
- Quick addition of new features, pages, contracts, or components at project creation
- Compatibility with Scaffold-Stark 2 core updates and improvements

Extensions are compact packages containing specific code (such as a smart contract or UI component) that automatically integrate with the latest version of Scaffold-Stark 2 when initializing a new project via npx. They are starting points for your project, not finished products.

## Installing Extensions

To install an extension when creating a new Scaffold-Stark 2 project, run:

```bash
npx create-stark@latest -e <extension-name>
```

## Available Extensions

You can find a complete list of available extensions, including both curated (by Scaffold-Stark) and community extensions, on [Scaffold-Stark website](https://scaffoldstark.com/extensions).
