# Deploy Your Smart Contracts

To deploy your smart contracts to a live network, there are a few things you need to adjust.

## 1. Configure your network

Scaffold-Stark 2 comes with a selection of predefined networks: `Devnet`, `Sepolia`, and `Mainnet`.

Here are the [Starknet docs](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/tools/api-services/) for information on Sepolia network providers.

## 2. Use pre-funded accounts and add one of them to deploy the contract(s) from.

The deployer account is the account that will deploy your contracts. Additionally, the deployer account will be used to execute any function calls that are part of your deployment script.

You can use any pre-funded account / private key or add your crypto wallet's private key.

### Configure Sepolia:

To use the Sepolia, set your own private key and configure the necessary environment variables by adding and replacing `yourWalletPrivateKey`, `yourWalletAddress` in the following:

Add the following to the `packages/snfoundry/.env` file:

If you are working with Sepolia, you need to use the setup:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY_SEPOLIA=yourWalletPrivateKey
RPC_URL_SEPOLIA=https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_8
ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA=yourWalletAddress
```

### Configure Mainnet:

To use the Mainnet, set your own private key and configure the necessary environment variables by adding and replacing `yourWalletPrivateKey`, `yourWalletAddress` in the following:

Add the following to the `packages/snfoundry/.env` file:

If you are working with Mainnet, you need to use the setup:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY_MAINNET=yourWalletPrivateKey
RPC_URL_MAINNET=https://starknet-mainnet.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_8
ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_MAINNET=yourWalletAddress
```

## 3. Changing the smart contract name

### Steps to Change the Contract Name:

- **Change the package name**:

  Rename package name (`pub mod ...`) in `.cairo` and `lib.cairo` file in the `contracts` directory to the desired name. For example, if you rename `pub mod YourContract` to `pub mod MyNewContract`, make sure rename it in `lib.cairo` too.

- **Update the `deploy.ts` Script**:

  After renaming the package name, open the `deploy.ts` script and change the contract name from `YourContract` to the new contract name you’ve chosen. The relevant section in the `deploy.ts` file will look like this:

  ```typescript
  const deployScript = async (): Promise<void> => {
    await deployContract({
      contract: "MyNewContract", // Change this to your renamed contract
      constructorArgs: {
        owner: deployer.address,
      },
    });
  };
  ```

- **(Optional) Deploy the same contract under a different name**:

  If you want to deploy the same contract but reference it under a different name, you can use `contractName`:

  ```typescript
  await deployContract({
    contract: "MyNewContract",
    contractName: "CustomDisplayName", // Allows multiple deployments with unique references
    constructorArgs: {
      owner: deployer.address,
    },
  });
  ```

  This can be useful if you want to:

  - Deploy multiple instances of the same contract with different identifiers.
  - Reference the deployed contract under a custom name for clarity in deployment logs.

## 4. Deploying Multiple Contracts

Scaffold-Stark makes it easy to deploy multiple contracts in a single deployment script. This is useful when you have contracts that depend on each other or when you want to deploy a complete dApp with multiple components.

### Basic Multiple Contract Deployment

To deploy multiple contracts, call `deployContract` multiple times within your `deployScript` function:

```typescript
const deployScript = async (): Promise<void> => {
  // Deploy first contract
  await deployContract({
    contract: "TokenContract",
    constructorArgs: {
      name: "MyToken",
      symbol: "MTK",
      initial_supply: 1000000n,
      recipient: deployer.address,
    },
  });

  // Deploy second contract
  await deployContract({
    contract: "VaultContract",
    constructorArgs: {
      owner: deployer.address,
    },
  });

  // Deploy third contract
  await deployContract({
    contract: "GovernanceContract",
    constructorArgs: {
      admin: deployer.address,
    },
  });
};
```

### Deploying Dependent Contracts

When one contract needs the address of another contract (e.g., a vault that interacts with a token), deploy them in order and capture the address:

```typescript
const deployScript = async (): Promise<void> => {
  // Deploy the token contract first
  const { address: tokenAddress } = await deployContract({
    contract: "TokenContract",
    constructorArgs: {
      name: "MyToken",
      symbol: "MTK",
      initial_supply: 1000000n,
      recipient: deployer.address,
    },
  });

  // Deploy the vault contract using the token address
  await deployContract({
    contract: "TokenVault",
    constructorArgs: {
      token_address: tokenAddress,  // Reference the deployed token
      owner: deployer.address,
    },
  });
};
```

### Deploying Multiple Instances of the Same Contract

Use the `contractName` parameter to deploy multiple instances of the same contract with unique identifiers:

```typescript
const deployScript = async (): Promise<void> => {
  // Deploy a vault for STRK tokens
  await deployContract({
    contract: "TokenVault",
    contractName: "StrkVault",  // Custom name for this instance
    constructorArgs: {
      token_address: STRK_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
      owner: deployer.address,
    },
  });

  // Deploy another vault for ETH tokens using the same contract
  await deployContract({
    contract: "TokenVault",
    contractName: "EthVault",  // Different custom name
    constructorArgs: {
      token_address: ETH_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
      owner: deployer.address,
    },
  });
};
```

Both vaults will be available in your frontend with their respective names (`StrkVault` and `EthVault`).

### Preserving Existing Deployments

By default, `yarn deploy` resets the `deployedContracts.ts` file. To add new contracts without losing existing deployments:

```bash
yarn deploy:no-reset
```

This is useful when iteratively adding contracts to your dApp.

## 5. Deploy your smart contract(s)

By default, `yarn deploy` will deploy the contract to the local network. You can change `defaultNetwork` in `scaffold.config.ts`.

Run the command below to deploy the smart contract to the target network. Make sure to have some funds in your deployer account to pay for the transaction.

```
yarn deploy --network <NETWORK_NAME>
```

e.g. `yarn deploy --network sepolia`

## 6. Configuration of Third-Party Services for Production-Grade Apps

By default, Scaffold-Stark 2 provides predefined API keys for popular public services such as [Blast](https://blastapi.io/chains/starknet). This allows you to begin developing and testing your applications more easily, avoiding the need to register for this service.

For production-grade applications, it's recommended to obtain your own API keys (to prevent rate limiting issues). You can configure these at:

- `RPC_URL_SEPOLIA` variable in `packages/snfoundry/.env` and `packages/nextjs/.env.local`. You can create API keys from the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://www.infura.io/).

:::tip Hint
It's recommended to store environment variables for Next.js in Vercel/system environment variable configuration for live apps and use `.env.local` for local testing.
