## Devnet Faucets

To mint tokens, either to an existing address or a new one, use the following cURL command with the JSON-RPC method:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/rpc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "devnet_mint",
    "params": {
      "address": "0x064b48806902a367c8598f4f95c305e8c1a1acba5f082d294a43793113115691",
      "amount": 1000000000000000000,
      "unit": "FRI"
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

:::note Breaking Change in Devnet v0.6.0
Starting from starknet-devnet v0.6.0, the old `POST /mint` endpoint has been removed. All devnet-specific functionalities are now only available as JSON-RPC methods. The `devnet_mint` method is the new way to mint tokens.
