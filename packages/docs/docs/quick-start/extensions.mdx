# Start with Extensions

Extensions are preloaded features on your scaffold-stark setup that can make your development faster by skipping implementation of basic common features. One command is all that is needed.

## Getting Started with Extensions

To create a new Scaffold-Stark project with extensions:

```bash
npx create-stark@latest --extension <extension-name>
```

OR

```bash
npx create-stark@latest -e <extension-name>
```
