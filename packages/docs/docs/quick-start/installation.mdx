# Installation

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Install developer tools

You can install the developer tools natively or use Dev Containers.

### Option 1: Natively install developer tools

#### 1.1 Starkup

Tool for installing all the Starknet essentials for development. [Starkup](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup) will install the latest stable versions of:

- [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) - Cairo package manager and build toolchain
- [Starknet Foundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/index.html) - Development toolchain for testing on Starknet
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) - Version manager to easily switch between tool versions
- [Cairo 1.0 extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1) for VSCode - Syntax highlighting and language support
- [Starknet Devnet](https://0xspaceshard.github.io/starknet-devnet/) - Starknet Devnet

To install `starkup`, run the following command:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.starkup.sh | sh
```

#### 1.2 Create your project

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-stark@latest
cd my-dapp-example
yarn install
```

Now you have a new project with the basic structure.

Now you are ready!!!. You can jump to [Quickstart 1](#quickstart-1-deploying-a-smart-contract-to-starknet-devnet) to start developing your dapp.

#### 1.3 Installing ASDF and ASDF fast installs

There might be some cases where you need to install the dependencies that are required by scaffold but not necessarily the latest version. In this case, you can use ASDF to install the dependencies by the following commans.

```bash
asdf install
```

#### 1.4 Troubleshooting

- If you run into version errors after using `starkup` or `asdf`, you can try to install the dependencies manually. Check the details below.

<details>

#### Scarb version

To ensure the proper functioning of scaffold-stark, your `Scarb` version must be `2.11.4`. To accomplish this, first check Scarb version:

```sh
scarb --version
```

If your `Scarb` version is not `2.11.4`, you need to install it. If you already have installed `Scarb` via `starkup`, you can setup this specific version with the following command:

```sh
asdf install scarb 2.11.4 && asdf set scarb 2.11.4
```

Otherwise, you can install Scarb `2.11.4` following the [instructions](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/download.html#install-via-asdf).

#### Starknet Foundry version

To ensure the proper functioning of the tests on scaffold-stark, your `Starknet Foundry` version must be `0.46.0`. To accomplish this, first check your `Starknet Foundry` version:

```sh
snforge --version
```

If your `Starknet Foundry` version is not `0.46.0`, you need to install it. If you already have installed `Starknet Foundry` via `starkup`, you can setup this specific version with the following command:

```sh
asdf install starknet-foundry 0.46.0 && asdf set starknet-foundry 0.46.0
```

Otherwise, you can install Starknet Foundry `0.46.0` following the [instructions](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/getting-started/installation.html#installation-via-asdf).

#### Starknet-devnet version

To ensure the proper functioning of scaffold-stark, your `starknet-devnet` version must be `0.4.3`. To accomplish this, first check your `starknet-devnet` version:

```sh
starknet-devnet --version
```

If your `starknet-devnet` version is not `0.4.3`, you need to install it.

- Install starknet-devnet `0.4.3` via `asdf` ([instructions](https://github.com/gianalarcon/asdf-starknet-devnet/blob/main/README.md)).

</details>

### Option 2. Dev Containers

#### 2.1 Install Docker Desktop

As an alternative to installing the tools locally (Scarb, Starknet Foundry, Starknet Devnet), you can use Docker, this is the recommended option for `Windows` users. Here's what you need to do:

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
2. Install [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Create a new project folder.

- `npx create-stark@latest`
- `cd my-dapp-example`

4. Check your project folder contains a `devcontainer.json` file. This file is used to set up the environment:

- The configuration uses the `starknetfoundation/starknet-dev:2.11.4` image.
- This includes all required tools pre-installed, such as Scarb, Starknet Foundry, Starknet Devnet and other dependencies.

#### 2.2 Getting Started with Docker Setup

To start using the Docker-based setup:

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Select **"Reopen in Container"**.
3. If you need to rebuild the container, open the Command Palette (**View -> Command Palette**) and choose:
   - **Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container**

> Once inside the container, you can start working with all the tools and dependencies pre-configured.

Now you are ready!!!

## Setup RPC specific version

<details>

To ensure the proper functioning of the scaffold-stark with Testnet or Mainnet, your RPC version must be `0.8.0`. This repository contains `.env.example` files, where we provided the default RPC URL for the Starknet Testnet: `RPC_URL_SEPOLIA=https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_8`. Let's verify this RPC version is `0.8.x` by calling a `POST` request in an API platform like `Postman` or `Insommia` . Your API endpoint should be `https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_8` and the body should be:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "starknet_specVersion",
  "id": 1
}
```

You have to paste the endpoint and body in the API platform and click on the `Send` button. If the response is `0.8.x`, then you are good to go. Otherwise, you have to get the correct RPC URL endpoint.

</details>

## Compatible versions

| Dependency      | Version |
| --------------- | ------- |
| scarb           | v2.11.4 |
| cairo           | v2.11.4 |
| rpc             | v0.8.x  |
| starknet-devnet | v0.4.3  |
| snforge         | v0.46.0 |
| starknet.js     | v7.6.2  |
| starknet-react  | v4-beta |

## Setup

For a simplified setup, Scaffold-Stark offers a npx method that guides you interactively through the setup.

```
npx create-stark@latest
```

You will be presented with a series of prompts:

- **Where to install files?:** Enter your project name, e.g., my-dapp-example. Or input `.` to install in the current directory.
- **Install packages?:** Press `Enter` for `yes` (default option) or type `n` and press `Enter` for no

Once the setup is complete, navigate to the project directory:

```
cd project-name
```
